# 3DS-Analysis
Statistical analysis on DNS data of turbulence generated by 3D Sparse multiscale grids (3DS) is carried out to understand how the geometric properties of these solid 3DS grids effect flow characteristics in a turbulent channel flow. 
Paraview python library is used to post-process the big data output of DNS results of turbulence.
Matlab, Paraview, gnuplot, matplotlib, SAS, Excel and Tableau are the main visualization and analysis tools used in this project.
