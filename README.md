# 3DS-Analysis
Statistical analysis on DNS data of turbulence generated by 3D Sparse multiscale grids (3DS) is carried out to understand how the geometric properties of these solid 3DS grids effect flow characteristics in a turbulent channel flow. 

Paraview python library is used to post-process the big data output of DNS results of turbulence.

Matlab, Paraview, gnuplot, matplotlib, SAS, Excel and Tableau are the main visualization and analysis tools used in this project.

Turbulence intensity, energy cascade, Reynolds stress, velocity mean and standard deviation, coherent structures, correlations and structure functions, density function theory, intermittency, wakes and jets, dissipation and decay, reflection, symmetry, mixing and boundary layers, vortex stretching, heat and scalar transport are some of the turbulence characteristics that were statistically observed and analyzed in this project and some of the findings are shared here.
